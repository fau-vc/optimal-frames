## Generic Objective Vortices for Flow Visualization ##
#######################################################

This folder contains a VTK implementation for the 2D case of the paper:
  
  Tobias GÃ¼nther, Markus Gross, Holger Theisel
  Generic Objective Vortices for Flow Visualization
  ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH), 2017.

============================================
VTK class vtkObjectivityFilter
============================================
The class vtkObjectivityFilter implements a vtkImageAlgorithm that transforms a given unsteady 2D vector field into an optimal reference frame. The user can set the neighborhood region for the local fitting of the reference frame transformation.

============================================
Example program ObjectivityFilter.cxx
============================================
The file ObjectivityFilter.cxx contains a command line program that demonstrates the vtkObjectivityFilter. The command line tool transforms a vector field that is given in the VTKImageData XML format (*.vti), and writes the result into a vti-file. Note that the vector field must be given in 2D space-time, i.e., the third dimension is time. 
The command line arguments are:
  1. the path to the vector field in *.vti XML format
  2. the neighborhood size
Example: "mypath.vti" 10
If no vector field is passed as argument, the command line tool uses a simple Stuart vortex vector field.

============================================
Requirements
============================================
Dependencies:
- C++ 11                 (tested with Visual Studio 2015)
- CMake                  (tested with CMake 3.6.2)
- VTK                    (tested with VTK 7.1.0)
- Eigen                  (tested with Eigen 3.3)

Tested on:
- Windows 10

============================================
Installation
============================================
Use CMake to setup your build environment. During configuration, the path to VTK (build folder) and Eigen (header-only library) must be specified.

The source code is kept simple and is meant for educational purposes only.
